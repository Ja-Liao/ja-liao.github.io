I'm a 4th-year undergraduate student at the **University of Toronto** studying **Robotics** 🤖. I’m expected to graduate in **May 2025** 🎓.

My interests lie in **Robotics** and **Software**, with hands-on experience in developing and optimizing robotic systems 🛠. I’ve worked on projects involving **SLAM algorithms**, **ROS2**, **sensor integration**, and **robotic control systems**. My focus is on **real-time performance optimization** and **algorithm development** to ensure efficient, autonomous operation 🚗.

I have also gained valuable experience during my internship at **AMD**, where I contributed to **hardware verification** and developed solutions in **Python**, **C++**, and **MATLAB** for system integration 💻.

Currently, I’m exploring career opportunities in both **software** and **hardware roles**, with a strong interest in **robotics**, **AI**, and **embedded systems** 🌐.
